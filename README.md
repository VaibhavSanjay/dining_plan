# What's Cooking?

A new Flutter project. UMD Dining

## What it does?

This is a mobile application that displays the daily updated menu (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner) for the current 3 UMD dining halls around campus (South diner, The Diner, and 251 North). Each diner traditionally has its own daily menu which varies from diner to diner. Users may filter to their diner of preference and see a live update of the menu. Furthermore, the functionality that we wanted to highlight is its versatility in being able to filter diner menu options for people with dietary restrictions. We found that many times (from personal experience) the trip made to the dining hall was not worth it as the limited selection of food items available to our diets was not worth the trip. Thus, we aimed to tackle the challenge of being able to keep terps connected and updated in a compact and reliable way as to what food was available to them. And what better way to do this than a mobile app.
A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:


## How it is built?

We used flutter to build the mobile front end of the application. Then, we used the Cockroach Database supported by Google Cloud to store meal data that was taken from the UMD dining menu website. Then we queried the database with SQL from within the app and displayed it. The app also provides filters to specify which types of food one is seeking.
